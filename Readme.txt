This program reads numbers from a file into an array and gives the user the ability to implement one of seven sorting methods to sort the array in ascending order. Four of the seven sorting methods are simple sorting methods. These methods include bubble sort, shell sort, insertion sort, and selection sort. The other three sorting methods are more advanced sorting methods. They are quick sort, heap sort, and merge sort. It's also important to note that after the user has chosen one sorting method, the array must be re-shuffled so it can be sorted once again if the user decides to implement other sorting methods. The array is re-shuffled automatically. The iterations of the sorting algorithms are displayed so the user can see how the array is being sorted during each pass.

This program was written for the Advanced C Programming course with UCSC Extension.
